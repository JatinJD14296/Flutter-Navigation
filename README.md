In flutter we identify screens as **'routes'** so, if we are talking about the home screen or the first screen, we are refering to the first route or the initial route of our application. 

Flutter has provided **navigator widget** and its methods to naviagate among screens. Furthermore in flutter **navigator widget** maintains all the **routes** (screens) as stack.
